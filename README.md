# Multi-Thread Scheduler

The Multi-Thread Scheduler is a C++ library that provides functionalities for managing and scheduling multiple threads in a multi-threaded environment. It includes features for creating, terminating, blocking, and resuming threads, as well as implementing scheduling algorithms such as Round-Robin (RR).

## Overview

The Multi-Thread Scheduler library offers the following key functionalities:
- Thread management: Create, terminate, block, and resume threads.
- Scheduling: Implement scheduling algorithms like Round-Robin to allocate CPU time to threads.
- Thread state management: Track the state of each thread (e.g., ready, running, blocked).
- Scalability: Support for managing a large number of threads efficiently.

## Features

- Thread creation and termination.
- Thread blocking and resuming.
- Round-Robin scheduling algorithm implementation.
- Thread state tracking and management.
